# Hackster Evaluation Web Interface 2025 -- Client Template

## Introduction

The client application consists of four main pages designed to facilitate the evaluation process:

1. **Login Page**: Collects evaluator identification and demographic information

2. **Tutorial Page**: Provides an introduction to the evaluation methodology and process
    ![Tutorial Page](./public/readme/tutorial.png)

3. **Evaluation Page**: Displays content customized according to the assigned evaluation condition. The interface varies based on experiment requirements, with four distinct evaluation conditions available. Below are examples from two conditions:

    ![Evaluation Page](./public/readme/evaluation-1.png)
    ![Evaluation Page](./public/readme/evaluation-2.png)

4. **Ending Page**: Confirms completion of the evaluation session and provides any necessary follow-up information

 This initial implementation focuses on core functionality for testing purposes. The user interface will be refined based on feedback from preliminary evaluations.
